In his hierarchy of needs, self-actualization is the peak of human flourishing. Had he created the hierarchy of needs for apple trees, fruitfulness might have been at the top of the pyramid with only the same general idea of physiological needs below that. Humans are clearly much more complex and have a handful of steps between having our physiological needs met and achieving self-actualization. Maslow's idea of self-actualization may be the most widely accepted notion of human flourishing. I believe this is because, when we first were introduced to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, we thought his ideas on the steps to self-actualization were a bit obvious. In a way, Maslow didn't exactly present any new ideas. We all know we have a base level of physiological needs with the additional needs of safety, love/belonging, and esteem atop of that."),"\n",o.createElement(t.p,null,'Often this is the case in science, and in positive psychology, many ancient but transcendent philosophical ideas turn into a more well established, defined, and accepted truism.

I knew it! I was just talking about this with Steve the other day. Now I\'ll just share with him without actually reading any of the article."
