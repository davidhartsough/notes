Sure, we can take a moment to throw a pity party for humanity, but (after a few tears into some of that delicious Hawaiian pizza that I ordered) we should soon find ourselves optimistic about our opportunities. I believe that idealism is a catalyst for revision. When we look at the ideal, we get a glimpse of what it would be to attain the actualization of our potentiality. Then once we've had a taste, we can either sit in self-centered sympathy or instill in ourselves a longing to move ever closer toward perfection. We look at where we are and realize that we have so much room for improvement — so much further to go.
