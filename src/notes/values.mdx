## Definitions

The concept of values is hairy. In the many lists you'll find below, you'll see that we tend to lump together a variety of things as all under the umbrella of "values":

- things we experience,
- things we like,
- states of being,
- things we do,
- things we feel,
- things we intend,
- things we seek, etc.

Since this term has been used and abused, there's no "right answer" to what the definition of "values" has to be. The point of exploring your personal values is **to conceptualize what you _prioritize_ and strive to _cultivate_ in life**.

Thus, as you explore your values, it's useful to recognize when you're talking about **experiences** vs **behaviors** vs **feelings** vs **states**, because the way you will prioritize and cultivate these varies significantly.

Lastly, always keep in mind the fact that values are all abstract concepts relative to real ("concrete") things ("entities" / "beings" / "objects") in the world, such as humans/humanity, animals, plants, the natural environment itself, Planet Earth, etc. The vast majority of people's "values" tend to all be about humans, but that's not always the case. Most values are either:

- Ethical beliefs [about the real things]
- Subjective experiences and internal states [for the real things]
- Desired behaviors [of the real things]
- Desired situations [involving the real things]

So, again, it's also useful to distinguish between **ethical beliefs**, **subjective experiences**, **internal states**, **desired behaviors**, and **desired situations**, because the way you will prioritize and cultivate these varies significantly.
