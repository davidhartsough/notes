The following are some of the most common methods you can use to support your peers:

- Validation
- Problem-solving
- Listening
- Motivation and encouragement
- Compassion
- Sharing similar issues
- Advice, practical tips, and suggestions
- Feedback
- Sharing feelings and thoughts about what was said
- Accountability for goals

In general, there are largely two main therapeutic approaches:

1. **Cognitive behavioral methods**: Manage your emotions, mind, and behavior (ex: CBT)
2. **Inner parts work**: Resolve inner conflicts and improve the relationship with yourself (ex: IFS)
